## Hey ðŸ‘‹, This is Unbreakablery
[![Gmail Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-unbreakablery@gmail.com-c14438?style=flat&logo=Gmail&logoColor=white&link=mailto:unbreakablery@gmail.com)](mailto:unbreakablery@gmail.com) [![Github Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-unbreakablery-grey?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white&link=https://github.com/unbreakablery/)](https://www.github.com/unbreakablery/) <p align='left'>One of my key objectives as a developer is to ensure that all work is done in a high-quality timely manner.

High quality: as this is what you are paying for, and will reduce any time required for revising the work. And in a timely manner: as I appreciate the underlying necessity for work to be delivered, both on time to fulfil your expectations and to also allow the project to be profitable.

Being a highly mission focused and driven individual, I thrive when there are well planned out tasks to undertake. I will loyally devote my time to create the most efficient and presentable solution to clients, and will not stop until I have achieved my objective.

Work Experience Summary: Over the past several years I have undergone a lot of online training to successfully deliver projects in most of the main programming languages and database protocol.

Main skills are :

- PHP v5.x, 7.x & 8, MySQL/MariaDB
- Object Oriented Programming in PHP, DDL, DCL, DML, DQL, TCL, Views, Stored Procedures, Functions, Transactions and Triggers
- Laravel v5.x & 8 + Vue v2 & 3
- RESTful APIs
- Html 4&5, CSS 2&3, Bootstrap 3,4,5, Tailwind CSS, Mobile Friendly Responsive
- JavaScript, JQuery, and plugins, AJAX, and JSON
- PSD, Figma to HTML&CSS(fast speed).
- SEO friendly
- Building a website from scratch and templates/themes
- Vuex and Vuetify
- MEAN and MERN stack
- Working with GitHub, GitLab, Trello, Jira, Asana

I see web development as a "learning to learn" sort of job where I am continually learning, as things are continually enhanced there is never a week where there are no new technological advancements.

I thoroughly enjoy this aspect of my job as is it keeps me on my toes and allows me to socialize with many of the world's best programmers.
