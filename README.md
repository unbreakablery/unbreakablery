<p align='left'>One of my key objectives as a developer is to ensure that all work is done in a high-quality timely manner.

High quality: as this is what you are paying for, and will reduce any time required for revising the work. And in a timely manner: as I appreciate the underlying necessity for work to be delivered, both on time to fulfil your expectations and to also allow the project to be profitable.

Being a highly mission focused and driven individual, I thrive when there are well planned out tasks to undertake. I will loyally devote my time to create the most efficient and presentable solution to clients, and will not stop until I have achieved my objective.

Work Experience Summary: Over the past several years I have undergone a lot of online training to successfully deliver projects in most of the main programming languages and database protocol.
  
Developed lots of global websites, online quiz/exam web app, business web dashboards, e-commerce, appointment, dating and internal business websites according to company workflow using PHP/MySQL/MariaDB, Laravel v5.x & 8.0/RESTful APIs and JavaScript/VueJS.

Especially, recently for 5 years, accepted, adjusted and altered Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Decentralized/Distributed/Oftentimes Public/Digital Ledger technologies into my stack. 

Dedicated and efficient full stack developer with 10 years experience in application layers, presentation layers, and databases.

I see web development as a "learning to learn" sort of job where I am continually learning, as things are continually enhanced there is never a week where there are no new technological advancements.

I thoroughly enjoy this aspect of my job as is it keeps me on my toes and allows me to socialize with many of the world's best programmers.
